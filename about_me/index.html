        <p>Kia Orana All. This is how we greet people in the Cook Islands. It literally means, 
            ‘May you live on’. I have always loved learning and I like the challenge. I am married 
            to my eternal companion and we have a 22-year-old son, and a 16-year-old daughter. 
            I work at the Ministry of Justice in the IT section.</p>
        <p>I am grateful that I can do online courses through BYU-Idaho, and work towards a degree. 
            I am doing Professional Studies, BS, with three different certificates. First is 
            Computer Programming, second is Computer-Aided Design and Drafting, and third is 
            Auto Service Technology. I think I took this class because it was a requirement in 
            Computer Programming, but I am loving it already. I can see myself in the future doing 
            web design. I am thinking after my retirement, that I can still do web design from the 
            comfort of my home.</p>
        <p>In about two weeks time,  I would have been a member for 48 years. There is a quote from 
            one of our leaders that I love. I can’t remember who said it, but he said that he wrote 
            to his father that he did not know why he is on a mission and his father said, “Forget 
            yourself, and go to work”. It could have been Thomas S. Monson. One of my favorite 
            scriptures is in Mosiah 3:19 where is asks us to put off the natural man, and become 
            a saint through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We are also asked to be as a little child.</p>
        <p>One hobby I enjoy is watching movies, but now that I am taking online classes, I am going 
            limit my time for watching movies. I wish you all the best in your study this semester. Keep smiling</p>
