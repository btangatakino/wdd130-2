            <h2>Information about the Cook Islands</h2>
            <p>One of the best times to visit the Cook Islands is during the Maire Nui Festival season. This is when the country celebrates their becoming self-governing. We do this by dancing, singing, chants, and other traditional items. This is at the end of July and early August. This is also the winter season, but is nothing compared to winter in New Zealand or other countries. It is the cooler time of the year. For those who does not like the heat, this might be the best time to travel. Temperatures never drop down to single digits. This is also outside the cyclone season which is November to April.</p>
            <p>There is an event called RRRR (Round Rarotonga Road Run) held annually and it attracts people from New Zealand and Australia and other parts of the world. It is approximately 32 km in length and the record have been under 2 hours within the last 5 years. I have participated in this event for 2 hours but have done only the 10km walk.</p>
            <p>There are many other enjoyable activities they can do, like kite-surfing, safari tours, lagoon cruises, cross island walk including hiking some of the highest spots on the island, and so many more. They have held the world kite surfing competition several years here in the Cook Islands. If you love fishing, this is one of the best places to fish. The water is crystal clear, so snorkeling or scuba diving is spectacular. You can even go and swim with the turtles.</p>
