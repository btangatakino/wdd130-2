        The Cook Islands is a Paradise on Earth. If you want to see one of the best beaches in the world, then come visit us. The beaches are white and the water is crystal clear. Make sure your have sunglasses to protect your eyes because the view is out of this world. If you have not been to the Cook Islands, make plans to visit, you will not regret it. One of the most repeated comments from visitors to the Cook Islands is that their visit was too short, and they surely will come back again. People who want to join events that are held in the country may also want to come.

        There are islands that are not spoilt and have their original beauty. Those who are interested in exploring caves might also be interested to come and visit. Mangaia, my home island, the southernmost island in the Cook Islands is the oldest island in the South Pacific. In Mangaia, there is a cave called Te Rua Rere, where no one has reached the end, and a pit (endless pit) where no one has reached the bottom. A few people have tried, but have ran out of rope and still could not see the bottom. So, if you are up for the challenge, come visit us. I myself have explored this cave and have gone as far as the endless pit.

        <h3>Answers to your Questions</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best times to visit the Cook Islands is during the Maire Nui Festival season. This is when the country celebrates their becoming self-governing. We do this by dancing, singing, chants, and other traditional items. This is at the end of July and early August. This is also the winter season, but is nothing compared to winter in New Zealand or other countries. It is the cooler time of the year. For those who does not like the heat, this might be the best time to travel. Temperatures never drop down to single digits. This is also outside the cyclone season which is November to April.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an event called RRRR (Round Rarotonga Road Run) held annually and it attracts people from New Zealand and Australia and other parts of the world. It is approximately 32 km in length and the record have been under 2 hours within the last 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other enjoyable activities they can do, like kite-surfing, safari tours, lagoon cruises, cross island walk including hiking some of the highest spots on the island, and so many more. They have held the world kite surfing competition several years here in the Cook Islands. If you love fishing, this is one of the best places to fish. The water is crystal clear, so snorkeling or scuba diving is spectacular. You can even go and swim with the turtles.
