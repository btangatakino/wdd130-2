            <h2>Come Visit the Cook Islands</h2>
            <p>The Cook Islands is a Paradise on Earth. If you want to see one of the best beaches in the world, then come visit us. The beaches are white and the water is crystal clear. Make sure your have sunglasses to protect your eyes because the view is out of this world. If you have not been to the Cook Islands, make plans to visit, you will not regret it. One of the most repeated comments from visitors to the Cook Islands is that their visit was too short, and they surely will come back again. People who want to join events that are held in the country may also want to come. </p>
            <p>There are islands that are upoilt and have their original beauty. Those who are interested in exploring caves might also be interested to come and visit. Mangaia, my home island, the southernmost island in the Cook Islands is the oldest island in the South Pacific. In Mangaia, there is a cave called Te Rua Rere, where no one has reached the end, and a pit (endless pit) where no one has reached the bottom. A few people have tried, but have ran out of rope and still could not see the bottom. So, if you are up for the challenge, come visit us. I myself have explored this cave and have gone as far as the endless pit.</p>
